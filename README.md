# PISA Data
## by Praprara Owodeha-Ashaka


## Dataset

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. This survey examines
    how well students have learned the school curriculum,
    how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
    
The dataset was too large to load on the spreadsheet software available to me (microsoft excel) so I made no visual assessments. I selected columns that piqued my interest through the attached data dictionary. Because there were 636 columns and 485490 columns,I assessed the columns that I explored, individually. many of the column names were non-descriptive of the data they contained but because the actual column descriptions were lenghty, I left them that way and used a python dictionary for temporary replacement, where necessary.



## Summary of Findings


To Not present: 

> Above a certain score, studying for more hours outside school seems to give lower grades
> Shanghai China is the most academically adept region, topping the average student score for all three courses
> Peru has the least scores
> Mexico is the country most represented in this survey
> Scores for maths are slightly worse than scores for reading and science

> Students from Kazakhstan study the most out of school hours, on average. But they have the 3rd least reading scores
> Number of hours spent studying outside school has a triangular scatter plot shape relationship with scores in the 3 courses
> Less students said that they encounter Word problems Frequently in tests than in math lessons.
> Less students also say that applied maths reasoning is encountered frequently in Tests than in lessons. This may be a signifier of lower quality test questions than lesson questions
> The people who think that applied reasoning is required less frequently in math tests than in lessons, have a slightly better math grade than those who think it comes up more frequently
> Students that believe that with enough effort they can suceed are more open to problem solving
> A lot more parents disagree that maths is important for their daughters' careers than for males. Gender equality seems to still have a long way to go among the older generation (lol)
> the students with more books had higher reading scores for females. However, for males, the ones with more than 500 books score somewhat less than the ones with 201-500 books. Also, females generally have higher reading scores than males


## Key Insights for Presentation

To Present


>In my presention, I first highlight the positive impact of Graphing Calculators on student Math scores, depite it being used by a vey low amount students. I point out the fact that the financial situation of students using graphing calculators
 is not much different from that of other students. Low Calculator usage in Indonesia, and its possible impact were the next topics of the presention. I end by chipping in the fact that Indonesia is the poorest student country and Qatar is the richest, but Qatar still has low math scores, to elaborate that wealth may be important, but it not channeled properly would lead to little or no improvement, hence the need for careful investigation into the Indonesian situation


I chose the insights that I chose because the they highlight the need for education reform in Indonesia. Peru has a worse performnce but I find it very interesting that so many students do not even use a calculator in indonesia.
